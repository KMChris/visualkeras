## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have already read the [README](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras/blob/master/README.md) and its FAQ section.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for [existing issues](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras/issues?q=is%3Aissue) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question and @Soontosh in the comments of that issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras/issues).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (Python, Keras, visualkeras, etc.), depending on what seems relevant.

## Reporting Bugs

If you come across a bug while using visualkeras, please open a new issue. You can use our *bug report template* to help structure your issue. In your issue, include the following details:
- A clear description of the bug.
- Minimal code and steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected behavior
- If applicable, a screenshot or example of the bug.
- Environment (OS, Python version, visualkeras version or commit hash, Keras version, etc.)
- Any additional context that might help us understand the issue.


## Suggesting Features and Improvements

To suggest new features or suggest improvements to existing features, please open a new issue. You can use our *feature request template* to help structure your suggestion. In your issue, include the following details:
- Whether or not your feature reqeust is related to a problem
- A description of the solution you'd like to see and what you want to happen
- A description of alternatives you've considered
- Any additional context that might help us understand the feature or improvement

## I Want To Contribute

If you want to contribute, please take a look at [existing issues](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras/issues) and see if you can help with any of them, in which case you can comment on the issue to express your interest. If you have a new idea, please open an issue to discuss it first. This helps us avoid duplicate work and ensures that your contribution aligns with the project's goals.

We also have a list of improvements that we would like to see in the project, which you can find in the project [README](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras/blob/master/README.md).


## Your First Code Contribution

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visualkeras.git
cd visualkeras
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to run the tests under the `tests/` folder to ensure everything is working correctly.

After making your changes and running the tests, you can submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code has somewhat clear commits and introduces appropriate tests for any new features or bug fixes.

When submitting a pull request, please include:
- A clear description of the changes you made.

@Soontosh or @paulgavrikov will review your pull request, rerun the tests on their end, and provide feedback. Please be patient, as it may take some time to get to your contribution.

When submitting documentation changes, please ensure that:
